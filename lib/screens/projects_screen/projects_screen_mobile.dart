It reads and parses user commands, identifying executable programs and their arguments. The shell searches for these executables in the environment and path, and then spawns child processes for their execution. After execution, it manages memory, captures output, and returns control to the loop. Shell scripting in this project supports functions, which aids in code reuse, readability, and maintenance, whether they are defined within the script or imported from external libraries. This project was a collaborative effort, with a team of three individuals working together to fully develop its functionality.",
